why i really like joji ?

from joji i got a really important lesson, that is never judge someone only from the internet
cause not all things on the internet are real. everybody in the internet are using mask even your idol 
on the internet are using a mask. a good people can be the worst on the internet and the bad people can be a very nice
people on the internet.
